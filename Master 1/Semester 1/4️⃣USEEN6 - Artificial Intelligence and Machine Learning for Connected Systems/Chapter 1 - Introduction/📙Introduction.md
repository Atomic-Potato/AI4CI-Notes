# Machine learning approaches
- **Supervised learning:** The model learns from labeled data (inputâ€“output pairs).
- **Unsupervised learning:** The model finds patterns or groups in unlabeled data.
- **Reinforcement learning:** The model learns by interacting with an environment and receiving rewards or penalties.
