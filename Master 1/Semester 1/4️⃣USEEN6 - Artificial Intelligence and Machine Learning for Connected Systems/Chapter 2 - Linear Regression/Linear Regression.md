Its a very simple approach for [[Introduction#Machine learning approaches|supervised learning]]. It is a useful tool for predicting a quantitative response and serves as a good jumping-off point for newer approaches.

# Simple linear regression
> [!info] goal
> it is an approach for predicting a **quantitative response Y**. On the basis of a **single predictor variable X**

It assumes an approximately linear relationship between X and Y:
$$\Large Y \approx \beta_0 + \beta_1X $$
where we have to find the values of betas to get the best model.
