Models that classify the output into some category

- Binary classifier: it is either some thing or not. It works if the estimated probability is greater than a given threshold

We use a logistic regression model that is similar to the linear regression model.

- check the sigmoid function wave

The model estimates:
- high prob for + instance (y=1)
- low prob for - instances (y=0)

Desicion trees are a learning method for approximating. nodes specify a test of some feature of the set. a branch descending from one node corresponds to of the possibile values of this attribute/feature

we can use **regularization** to limit our tree model from overfitig. or by **pruning**
