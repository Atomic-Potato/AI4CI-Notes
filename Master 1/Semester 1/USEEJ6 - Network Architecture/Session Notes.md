# Chapter 1: Intro
packet transimssion delay = time needed to tramist L-bit packet into link = L (bits) / R (bits/sec)

Difference between `Forwarding` (local) and `Routing` (global) 

Packet switching vs Circuit switching

nodal delay = processing + queueing + transmission + propagation

Network layers

# Chapter 2: Application layer
HTTP uses TCP. non persistent HTTP 1.0 closes the TCP connection for every object, persistent HTTP 1.1 keeps the connection open for every object
