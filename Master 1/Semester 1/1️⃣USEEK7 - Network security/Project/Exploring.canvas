Possible directions for a _new solution idea_\n\nHere are several promising research directions that are **simple yet original enough** for your paper.  \nYou could pick one (or mix two) as your central contribution.\n\n---\n\n### üß† Idea 1 ‚Äî **Wi-Fi Certificate Transparency (like HTTPS for networks)**\n\n#### Concept\n\nEach legitimate Wi-Fi provider (like Starbucks, CNAM, etc.) could register its SSID and BSSID pair in a **public ‚Äúcertificate transparency‚Äù log**.  \nWhen a device connects to ‚ÄúStarbucks_WiFi,‚Äù it queries the log over cellular or cached data to verify:\n\n> ‚ÄúIs this SSID‚ÄìBSSID pair signed by a trusted issuer?‚Äù\n\nIf not, it warns the user or blocks the connection.\n\n#### Why it‚Äôs novel\n\n- Borrowing a concept from HTTPS certificate transparency.\n    \n- No new hardware needed ‚Äî it‚Äôs a **software-layer trust system**.\n    \n- Can work incrementally (e.g., trusted venues register voluntarily).\n    \n\n#### Challenges to discuss\n\n- Log synchronization and availability.\n    \n- How to prevent privacy leaks from lookups.\n    \n\n---\n\n### üß† Idea 2 ‚Äî **Crowdsourced Wi-Fi Legitimacy Verification**\n\n#### Concept\n\nWhen users connect to Wi-Fi, their devices anonymously share metadata (SSID, BSSID, GPS location) to a shared reputation database.  \nDevices cross-check new networks with this data ‚Äî if many users nearby reported the same SSID‚ÄìBSSID pair, it‚Äôs likely legitimate.  \nIf not, the device warns the user:\n\n> ‚ÄúNo other users have connected to this hotspot here before ‚Äî possible rogue AP.‚Äù\n\n#### Why it‚Äôs novel\n\n- Uses a **social-trust or reputation-based system** rather than certificates.\n    \n- Lightweight, privacy-friendly if designed well (aggregate data).\n    \n- Works even for small public networks with no formal registration.\n    \n\n---\n\n### üß† Idea 3 ‚Äî **Signal Fingerprinting + Behavioral Trust**\n\n#### Concept\n\nInstead of relying only on SSID/BSSID, a device could build a **fingerprint** of trusted APs:\n\n- Signal strength variation over time (RSSI pattern).\n    \n- Beacon interval and timing jitter.\n    \n- Channel usage patterns.\n    \n\nA fake AP rarely reproduces these physical characteristics exactly.\n\n#### Why it‚Äôs novel\n\n- Low-cost: only requires local analysis.\n    \n- Could use machine learning or threshold matching to classify known vs. new signals.\n    \n\n#### Limitation\n\n- False positives if the real AP‚Äôs environment changes (e.g., moved, replaced).\n    \n\n---\n\n### üß† Idea 4 ‚Äî **Multi-Factor Wi-Fi Authentication (Beyond Passwords)**\n\n#### Concept\n\nAdd a second factor for networks that support it ‚Äî for example:\n\n- A QR code displayed at the venue that devices must scan to verify the AP‚Äôs identity.\n    \n- Or, a short challenge message signed by a backend server, verified by the device.\n    \n\n#### Why it‚Äôs novel\n\n- Combines physical-world verification (you see the code at the caf√©) with network authentication.\n    \n- Makes attacks impractical without physical access.\n    \n\n---\n\n## ‚úçÔ∏è 4. Recommended direction for your paper\n\nGiven that your goal is an **8-page report** (not a PhD thesis), the best balance between simplicity and originality would be:\n\n> **Crowdsourced Wi-Fi Legitimacy Verification System**\n\nIt‚Äôs easy to explain, fits well into the ‚Äúopen problem‚Äù category, and allows you to:\n\n- Describe the **attack** and its **current limits** clearly.\n    \n- Introduce your idea of a **reputation-based verification protocol**.\n    \n- Discuss **how it works, what data it needs, how privacy is preserved**, and **potential drawbacks**.\n    \n\nYou can call your proposal something like **‚ÄúWiGuard: A Crowdsourced Trust Framework for Detecting Fake Wi-Fi Access Points.‚Äù**\n\n--- \n\n# Papers\n- [Convolutional neural network based evil twin attack detection in WiFi networks](https://www.matec-conferences.org/articles/matecconf/abs/2021/05/matecconf_cscns20_08006/matecconf_cscns20_08006.html)\n- [EvilScout: Detection and Mitigation of Evil Twin Attack in SDN Enabled WiFi](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8989802) \n- "}
