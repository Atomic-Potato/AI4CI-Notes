Select a use case of your choice, perform an in-depth vulnerability analysis against a particular type of attack, and outline a detailed attack model. Then, research and identify multiple countermeasures by referencing published research papers. Evaluate these countermeasures to discuss how the attack could be eectively detected or prevented within the chosen scenario.

## How to define a problem
- the 4 paragraphs to define a problem:  
	- problem in a scenario,
	- the vulnerability of the problem
	- what has been done,  
	- what hasn't been done / what is your contribution
