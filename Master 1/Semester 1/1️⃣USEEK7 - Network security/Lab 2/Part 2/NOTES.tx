i tried first doing the common authority certificate method for both swanctl and ipsec first,
but it kept giving me an authentication error whenever i try to start the tunnels.

And i wanted to redo self signed certificate method with swanctl, but i was so frustrated at this point
either way it is the same process for swanctl, 
same certificates, 
same fields in the swanctl.conf but different syntax
same process of starting the tunnel but using the swanctl command

aight thanks :]
